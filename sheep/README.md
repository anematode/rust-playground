# Ergonomics.txt

A script contains commands and comments. Comments are enclosed in parentheses, and they can contain matching pairs of parentheses.

Commands are structured like an English sentence. They start with a capital letter and end with a period.

## Formatting

Formatting is rather strict. Sentences must be capitalized, and all other letters must be lowercase except for proper nouns. Only the first letter of a proper noun may be capitalized.

Whitespace is somewhat generous. Between words and after commas and periods, there can be at least one whitespace character, including spaces and newline characters. There may not be whitespace before a comma or a period.

Pronouns, too, are somewhat progressive. Consistent gender is not enforced, and forms of the singular "they" may be used.

## Commands

- `name` - A proper noun, such as "`Alice`" or "`Billy`," that represents a variable name.

- `reflexive pronoun` - Either "`herself`," "`theirself`," or "`himself`."

- `integer` - For example, `-5000` or `64`.

- `float` - For eaxmple, `-5000.0`, `0.2`, or `64`. The leading 0 is obligatory. Decimal commas are not allowed.

**Let us** (**also**) **consider `name`, an Intellectual, who finds `reflexive pronoun` worth** ... either **1 unit** or **`integer` units** ...**.**

> Let us consider Alice, an Intellectual, who finds herself worth 5 units.

Creates a new integer type variable with the given name and initializes the value.

**Let us** (**also**) **consider `name`, an Flotation Device, who finds `reflexive pronoun` worth** ... either **1 pizza** or **`float` pizzas** ...**.**

> Let
us also consider David, an Flotation Device, who finds himself worth -5.4 pizzas.

Creates a new float type variable with the given name and initializes the value.

### Too lazy to do the rest

**Let us mash Alice and Bob violently, producing Charles.** Adds the values of two variables and stores the sum in another variable. (C = A - B)

**Let us also remove Chang from David, yielding Felicity.** Subtracts the values of two variables and stores the difference in another variable. (F = D - C)

**Let us also have Chang and David reproduce, birthing George.** Multiplies the values of two variables and stores the product in another variable. (G = C * D)

**Let David chop up Chang, resulting in Emily.** Divides the values of two variables and stores the quotient in another variable. (E = C / D)

Variables are constants, but there is a large selection of names that you can choose from.

**Allow Charles to declare his worth.** Logs the value of a variable.

**Hm.** Does nothing, like `pass` in Python.
